# django_shop_starter
Django setup with basic funcionalities that make up an online shop.

Initially, I have added basic functionalities that however easy might seem, constitute the basics of such complex solutions
as an online shop.
- Registering as a user (-> to be complemented with a model that will serve as user profile)
- Uploading data: select a file, read it in pandas and create entries from the data. This will serve the much respected
  functionality of uploading products from an Excel file. This will be restricted to admins only by adding permissions.
- Some simple yet catching JavaScript animations that serve one goal only: to demonstrate how minimalistic ideas can 
  contribute to an individualized user experience (UX)
